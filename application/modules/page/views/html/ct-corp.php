                                    The group was founded in 1987 by the chairman and principal shareholder Mr. Chairul Tanjung under the name of Para Group. The business started originally in the manufacturing of footwear for export and roof tiles for the domestic housing industry. From 1995 onwards, the group expanded into new business sectors in the area of financial services, property and multimedia. It is within this period that the group gained scale and depth in respective industries and to build a solid foundation for future growth. </p>

                                <p>Today, the group’s interests include, among other: financial services (Bank Mega), television (Trans TV and Trans 7), online portal (detik.com), large retail (Carrefour), luxury retail (over 25 luxury brands of fashion), restauration (The Coffee Bean, Baskin Robbins, Wendy’s), hospitality (The Trans Luxury Hotel, Trans Studio theme parks, Trans Studio Centre Bandung), travel (AntaVaya), and agribusiness (CT Agro) </p>

                                <p>The Para Group name was rebranded to become CT Corp. In short, CT Corp is a brand that embeds Mr. Chairul Tanjung's name and character into the company. That is essential in contributing values of optimism and revolutionary leadership of the future into the company. In addition, this was a strategic step to reposition the group as a multi-national group, ready to expand into the region and other parts of the globe. </p>
